# UW_MSDS_Data512_Au23_HW1

The goal of the project is to visualize the article traffic of award winning movies between 2015 and 2023. The list of the articles comes from [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A1h_7KAo7KXaVxdScJmIVPTvjb3IuY9oZhNV4ZHxrxw/edit#gid=1229854301)


The source data (licenses) used in the project is a PageViews API called Wikimedia Foundation REST API: [terms of use](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/REST_API#Terms_and_conditions), with its [documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews) and [endpoint](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_aggregate_project_access_agent_granularity_start_end).


Intermediary data files include: X - with fields of ...

Final output files include: Y - with fields of ...

Known issues/special considerations: for now, there exists movies in the list of articles that have no data from the PageViews API we used.
